            <p>Welcome to Blocktainer, home of the&nbsp;block.</p>

        <div class="block wide-6 bg-green-1 tall-6">
            <h2>Here's the first block</h2>
            <p>I mean, I guess it's a pretty nice block if you just take it for what it is. And look, there's a picture of a cool lake right by a glacier in Iceland!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block wide-6 tall-10 image-glacier-lake"></div>
        <div class="block wide-6 tall-4 bg-white">
            <h3>And this is the third block</h3>
            <p>It's the third item, but notice how the large block to the right continues to fill the vertical space here.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- three stripe -->
        <div class="block wide-4 tall-4 center-vt-hz">
            <h3>Oh, Hey</h3>
            <p>Didn't see you there before. Hello, you.</p>

        <div class="block wide-4 tall-4 center-vt-hz">
            <h3>These are in thirds</h3>
            <p>So, you know, that's pretty cool and all.</p>

        <div class="block wide-4 tall-4 center-vt-hz">
            <h3>Third thing</h3>
            <p>There's always gotta be three things. Every time.</p>

            <h2>A Taller Block</h2>
            <p>Maybe a longer paragraph can go into one of these taller blocks. The point is to flexibly accommodate all knids and sizes of content.</p>
            <p>Let's list all the reasons this trip was super great:</p>
            <ul class="text-small">
                <li>You get to wear fun hats.</li>
                <li>Eat cheeseburgers every day.</li>
                <li>Great bars and other kinds of spots to hang out.</li>
                <li>Oh yeah, and the views and all that are nice..</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="block tall-3 bg-white center-vt-hz">
            <h4>And this is how things get even more fun...</h4>

        <div class="block tall-4 center-vt-hz">
            <h2>So let's get into some rows.</h2>
