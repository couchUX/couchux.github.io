            <h1>I guess this is a title.</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Blocktainer, home of the&nbsp;block.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block wide-6 bg-green-1">
            <h3>Here's the first block</h3>
            <p>I mean, I guess it's a pretty nice block if you just take it for what it is. And look, there's a picture of a cool lake right by a glacier in Iceland!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block wide-6 bg-gray-1">
            <h3>And this is the third block</h3>
            <p>It's the third item, but notice how the large block to the right continues to fill the vertical space here.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- three stripe -->
        <div class="block wide-4 center-vt-hz">
            <h3>Oh, Hey</h3>

            <h3>These are in thirds</h3>
            <p>So, you know, that's pretty cool.</p>

            <h3>Third thing</h3>
            <p>There's always gotta be three.</p>

                <h2>A Taller Block</h2>
                <p>Maybe a longer paragraph can go into one of these taller blocks. The point is to flexibly accommodate all knids and sizes of content.</p>
                <p>Let's list all the reasons this trip was super great:</p>
                <ul class="text-small">
                    <li>You get to wear fun hats.</li>
                    <li>Eat cheeseburgers every day.</li>
                    <li>Great bars and other kinds of spots to hang out.</li>
                    <li>Oh yeah, and the views and all that are nice..</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="block wide-6 short-0 bg-blue-2 text-center">
                <h3>This one's called "Lady on her phone."</h3>
                <p>I bet she's typing something great.</p>

        <div class="block short-0 bg-gray-1 center-vt-hz">
            <h4>And this is how things get even more fun...</h4>

        <div class="block center-vt-hz">
            <h2>So let's get into some rows.</h2>
